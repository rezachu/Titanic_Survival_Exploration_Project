# Titanic Survival Exploration

## Overview
This is the first optional project of the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree, and the course is co-created with Kaggle. In this project, we are going to build an algorithm to predict the survival accuracy for the titanic tragedy. The objective is to reach 80% accuracy rate and I achieved 82.49% in this project.

## Software requirement

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

## Documents included in the repository

- `README.md`
- `titanic_data.csv`
- `Titanic_Survival_Exploration.html`
- `Titanic_Survival_Exploration.ipynb`
- `titanic_visualizations.py`

### Memo to Python beginner
In case you are new to Python and you do not know how to create an environment and install the package, here are few links that could help.
- [Managing Python](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/py2or3.html)
- [Managing Environments](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html)
- [Create Virtual Environments for Python with Conda](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/)

## Run 
1. Start your the terminal or command line
2. Activate your environment
3. Navigate to the root directory of this repository (./Titanic_Survival_Exploration_Project/)
4. Run `jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_Exploration.ipynb`

Then the web browser would open the jupyter notebook.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is included as `titanic_data.csv`. This dataset is provided by Udacity and contains the following attributes:

- `survival` : Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
- `pclass` : Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
- `name` : Name
- `sex` : Sex
- `age` : Age
- `sibsp` : Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
- `parch` : Number of Parents/Children Aboard
- `ticket` : Ticket Number
- `fare` : Passenger Fare
- `cabin` : Cabin
- `embarked` : Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
